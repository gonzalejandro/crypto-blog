# Edition

## Develop

Edition was built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) version 3.3.1, but should support newer versions as well.

Install the dependencies with [Bundler](http://bundler.io/):

~~~bash
$ bundle install
~~~

Run `jekyll` commands through Bundler to ensure you're using the right versions:

~~~bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
~~~

## Editing

Edition is already optimised for adding, updating and removing documentation pages in CloudCannon.

### Documentation pages

* Add, update or remove a documentation page in the *Documentation* collection.
* Change the category of a documentation page to move it to another section in the navigation.
* Documentation pages are organised in the navigation by category, with URLs based on the path inside the `_docs` folder.
